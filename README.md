# Make it Flow!

The objective of this project is to simplify the creation of z/OSMF workflows by allowing the developer to create workflows using YAML instead of XML, very similar to the concept of Ansible Playbooks. The project is developed in Typescript so it can be easily integrated with Zowe projects.
